Kiwigo Mailbox is a web application that supports to read emails from multiple AWS S3 buckets.

## Features

- Read emails from AWS S3 bucket

#### Roadmap

- [ ] Add email search functionality
- [ ] Add email filter functionality
- [ ] Add loading ui when fetching emails
- [ ] Fetch email pagination
- [ ] Save bucket configuration to cloud

## Getting Started

There are several steps to start using Kiwigo Mailbox:

1. Create a S3 bucket in AWS.
2. Create credentials of read access for the bucket.
3. Setting [CORS configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ManageCorsUsing.html) for the bucket.

IAM policy granting read access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowBucketRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:listBucket", "s3:getObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<your_bucket_name>", "arn:aws:s3:::<your_bucket_name>/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

A sample CORS configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

You can store emails in an S3 bucket in any way you choose, or you might consider using the [AWS SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email.html) for better integration.
